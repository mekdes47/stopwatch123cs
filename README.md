# Console Stopwatch Application

## Overview
This is a console-based stopwatch application implemented in C#. It allows users to start, stop, and reset a stopwatch using a simple text-based interface. Events are used to notify the user of key actions such as starting, stopping, or resetting the stopwatch, and these actions are handled through event delegates.

## Features
- **Start the Stopwatch:** Begins tracking time and displays the elapsed time in seconds.
- **Stop the Stopwatch:** Pauses the time tracking without resetting the elapsed time.
- **Reset the Stopwatch:** Resets the elapsed time to zero.
- **Real-Time Updates:** Displays the elapsed time every second while running.
- **Event Notifications:** Displays messages for actions like "Stopwatch Started," "Stopwatch Stopped," and "Stopwatch Reset."

## How to Run
1. **Prerequisites**:  
   Ensure you have the [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) installed on your system.

2. **Clone the Repository** (or copy the code):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ConsoleStopwatch
   ```

3. **Build the Project**:  
   Run the following command to compile the project:
   ```bash
   dotnet build
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:  
   Execute the application with:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

## Usage
When the application is running, use the following commands to interact with the stopwatch:
- Press **S** to start the stopwatch.
- Press **T** to stop the stopwatch.
- Press **R** to reset the stopwatch.
- Press **Q** to quit the application.

## Code Structure
- **Stopwatch Class**:  
  Contains the core logic for starting, stopping, resetting, and tracking time. It also defines events to notify the main program about actions.
  
- **Program Class**:  
  Implements the user interface and event handlers. Listens to user input and interacts with the `Stopwatch` class.

## Example Output
```

Commands: [S] Start, [T] Stop, [R] Reset, [Q] Quit
Enter command: S

Time Elapsed: 1 seconds
